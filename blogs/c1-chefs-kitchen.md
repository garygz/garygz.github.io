11/2/2014

Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?

I am generally excited about DBC and these are the things that make me excited:
1. DBC is a start up company which actively innovates the way programming is taught.
2. As a person who has been running a software company I am always excited to be taught
and share my experiences with people who have been brave enough to start their own companies
and creative enough to start innovating in this space.
3. As an experienced and certified Java developer who has developed a commercial product, I hope to
bring as much to the program as well as take from it.

What is your impression of DBC?

DBC is a new hot start up company which has a completely new holistic approach to education.
I have been taking an old fashion courses and found to be limited in terms of putting various
new technologies together. This is where DBC is different as they focus on hard skills as well
on the soft skills( e.g. team work, empathy).

How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?

I feel like I am perfect fit for the start up mentality culture which has been created at DBC.
It focuses on collaboration and creativity and that's exactly the kind of culture that I am interested in.

Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?

It's too early to have a constructive feedback on my experience at DBC but I eager to get to the next phase.

Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

I am excited and confident that I can complete the work but do anticipate long hours and bit of frustration
which is usually associated with learning new technologies.
