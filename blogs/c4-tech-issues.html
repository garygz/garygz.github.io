                <p>Net neutrality is a term that implies that all traffic over broad band service has to be treated with no any particular preference by Internet Providers. Internet providers has long been wanting to provide faster service to the highest paying customer (i.e. big corporations) by significantly slowing down the band-width available to small companies or free web-sites. If they get their way people will not be able to access those free web-sites as the loading times for this sites will slow down to a crawl. If net neutrality is not supported, there will not be a way for new start up companies to get access to customers and build the next generation of social networking apps and continue to innovate. Ability of people to publish free content and free speech in general will be jeopardized as a few global, corporate giant media or tech companies will be able to control which web-sites can be accessed. President Obama strongly supports net neutrality and recommended that FFC enforces the rule.</p>
                <p>However, the D.C. Circuit is expected to rule on the FCC's regulations in January, and based on the oral argument in September, it's not looking good for the FCC. Two of the three judges on the panel appeared ready to strike down significant portions of the rules, which bar Internet service providers from discriminating between websites. The controversy over net neutrality is reignited once again in 2014.
                <p/>
                <p>
                    It is hard to underestimate the importance of net neutrality to our every day lives as it is the only avenue for really independent free media and free speech. Not only it provides free media to express our opinions openly but it also allows a lot of small businesses all across America to compete with corporate giants and provide jobs for millions of every day citizens.
