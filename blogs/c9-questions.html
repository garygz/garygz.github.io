                    <p>
                        <p>Before you decide to post your technical question online, take some time to do research and look through similar questions. Asking the questions which were already answered seems like a lack of basic courtesy to online community and will probably be ignored.</p>
                        <p>
                       In order to get the right answer for your technical questions online, a question should be asked in a very specific way. First, start with the title. It has to be very specific and descriptive by itself. Here is an example of a good and bad question title:</br>
                       <strong>Bad:</strong> Coding problem in Ruby</br>
                       <strong>Good:</strong> Why is dividing 5 by 2 returns 2 in Ruby?
                        </p>
                        <p>Second, describe the problem with much detail but take some time to come up with a very specific description of the problem, avoiding the long story. Imagine that you only have 10 seconds on an elevator to ask a busy colleague your question before posting  your question online.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Third, try to give a little sample program so that the readers can reproduce the issue. Do not copy and paste the actual code from your application as it might be against your employer's policy but try to create a simple piece of code that shows how to reproduce the issue. Include the detailed information about the environment on which you are running your code as there are plenty of errors that occur not because the code itself is wrong but because of the bugs in other libraries or configuration environment being incompatible. Sometimes, issues occur because you have older versions of libraries installed that do not support the feature or have a bug that was fixed in later versions.
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, make a great impression on the online community by checking the spelling and grammar.
                    </p>
