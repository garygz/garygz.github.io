                    <p>Recently I had a very hard pairing sessions. The challenge itself was not hard but unlike my previous sessions where I was able to have a very productive and fluent experience, this session, from the start, did not go well as the session driver decided to both navigate and drive at the same time. To further complicate the situation, his approach to solving the challenge did not follow the main principles of good OO design.When I started pointing out that the code is not DRY and asking him to re-write it, my pair became combative and un-responsive to my arguments. I did feel offended and angry at the fact that clearly the best choice was ignored and second that my arguments to make the code DRY where simply disregarded. Unable to contain my anger I let my emotions overtake me which made the situation even worse. However, since I was practicing meditation for several months, I was able to contain my emotions and apologized - letting the other person know that I simply wanted to get the best possible code and perhaps did not allow him to go through the session learning the JavaScript on his own terms.</p>
                    <p>There are several lessons that I learned from that conflict. First, I should schedule pairing sessions at the time when I am less likely to be stressed out and thus be more in control of my emotions. Second, the purpose of the pairing sessions is letting people learn at their own pace and that the questions of the best design should be left for the end of the session to discuss with the guide.</p>
