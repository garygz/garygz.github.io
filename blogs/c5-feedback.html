                <p>The most challenging thing about pair programming at DBC is scheduling the pairing session especially now while everyone still studies remotely and some of us maintain regular working hours. However, once we pass the endless emailing and group posting hoping that someone will be available at the right day and time, pair programming can be rewarding and educational at the same time. Students at DBC are a very interesting and diverse group: different states, different countries and different career backgrounds. Whenever I have to pair with a new person I am forced to adapt my communication and thinking style to successfully drive our team through solving a tough problem in a limited amount of time regardless of their background and experience. It requires patients, ability to clearly organize my thoughts, verbalize the step by step process and show leadership in completing the challenge. The benefits of this is manifold as it teaches the leadership skills as well as communications skills which are the key in today's workplace.</p>
                <p>A big part of pair programming is giving and receiving feedback. This can be challenging at times, as coming up with specific, actionable and kind feedback requires a lot of contemplation. Receiving it on the other end, can be both educational and irritating. As a result of the feedback that I have received so far I have been able to improve my communicational skills. As an experienced developer, I sometimes take certain aspects of algorithm development for granted and jump to coding without explaining how I come with the specific solution. After receiving feedback indicating that some people find this as a sign of not trying to be engaging and a good team player, I have made an effort to be a better communicator of the small steps required to come up with a solution. As a result, my feedback in that regard has improved.<p/>
