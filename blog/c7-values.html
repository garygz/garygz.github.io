<p>If I have to pick one single value that is important to me that would be Achievement. The drive to achieve is an overwhelming feeling that forces me to do more and go beyond what a typical person would consider sufficient. Over my career, I have had to learn different programming languages and platforms (PowerBuilder, Java, PERL, JSP, J2EE). In our company I have had to wear many hats as a developer, support specialist, software architect. While it was very stressful, at the end of the day when our software went from being sold to a handful of small companies to being used at every Fortune 500 company as well as many small companies in every corner of the world, the sense of the achievement has made the scarifies well worth it. As an immigrant, I think my personal experience confirms that anything can be achieved through hard work and perseverance. So the best way to combat stereotypes at DBC will be through hard work and achieving results.
