  <!--Remember your [Gregorc Thinking Style](http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm) from your pre-Phase 0 work? If you can't remember what you are, retake the [personal thinking style](http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html) quiz.

Research your thinking style and consider how you can use your understanding of your thinking style to your advantage at DBC to help you learn.

Reflect on your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.

Now, contemplate the idea of [growth vs. fixed mindset](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/). Part of knowing about your thinking styles is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we also want to encourage you to broaden the ways you learn and think. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think. The more well-rounded you are, the easier it will be to learn quickly and effectively.


  I 4 x 4 = 16    Concrete Sequential (CS)
II 7 x 4 =  28  Abstract Sequential (AS)
III 8 x 4 =  32   Abstract Random (AR)
IV 9 x 4 =   36  Concrete Random (CR)

   Concrete Sequential Thinkers tend to be based in reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way.
   Concrete Random Thinkers are experimenters.
   Abstract Random Thinkers organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments.
   Abstract Sequential Thinkers love the world of theory and abstract thought.

It appears that my two strongest traits of thinking are Abstract Random and Concrete Random. Abstract Random way of thinking implies that I organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments while Concrete Random way of thinking thrives on experimentation. I think that would perfectly fit into hands-on, team work DBC culture. Once we start the Unit 2 at the main office, being able to work with other people and work on the projects at the end of the day to reinforce the understanding of the topics covered during the lectures should play well into my way of learning. So far, I greatly enjoyed pairing sessions as it forced to me be more verbal about the CSS and HTML concepts which helps me retain the material as well as to feel a contributing part of the team. Pairing with others also helped me discover new CSS settings that otherwise I would not use and allowed the pairing session guides who are at the forefront of the web-development to force to use the best practices and the new elements of the HTML5 which I so far ignored assuming that they are not fully supported in all browsers. My latest guide Caroline was kind enough to point me to the HTML5 testing site which allowed me to test out different browsers and make sure that most of them do support HTML5 at least 80%.
<br/>While I have been developing software for 15 years, I feel that the Information Technology field is unlike any other carrier path requires us to stay open minded and have a 'growth mind' instead of 'fixed mind' to keep up with the ever changing technologies.
