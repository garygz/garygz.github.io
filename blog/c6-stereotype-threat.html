<div class="entry_header">Stereotype Threat</div>
<div class="entry_sub_header">What it is and how it affects academic performance</div>

<div class="entry_text">
  <p>According to Claude Steele's and Joshua Aronson's research conducted in 1995, negative stereotypes which are imposed on any ethnic or social economic group, have an adverse effect on their academic performance. In their research a group that was stereotyped as less intelligent showed more duress during test taking and thus performed lower then a group that was not stereotyped.
  </p><p>While that research focused mainly on performance of African-Americans vs European-Americans, it also applies to other types of ethnic and social groups. Stereotype threat can even have a lifting effect on certain groups such as Asian-Americans or Indian-Americans for example. Being associated with a specific group can subconsciously affect the mindset and the need to conform to the stereotype whether it is positive or negative.
  </p>
  <p>In my personal life I can report that being associated with Jewish ethnicity can both have a positive and stress inducing negative effect. In the past, Jewish ethnicity had to perform academically to much greater degree in order to obtain the same employment level as White Anglo-Saxon Protestant group. This created additional pressure to perform well above the average. As a result it might have produced a feeling of being inadequate when my performance was on par with my peer-group and actually reduced my test scores as the additional psychological pressure has started to affect me.
  </p>
  <p>Bringing my own personal experience with being stereotyped, I would be more consciouses of avoiding stereotypes and treat colleagues on my team based on the merit of their work. It is the best way to promote a healthy environment at work which should lead to the high achievement levels of the entire team.
