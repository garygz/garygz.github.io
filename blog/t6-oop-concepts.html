#### Option 1. OO vs. Functional Programming
So you've had some experience with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) this week. Some consider Functional programming the opposite of OO - compare them.

#### Option 2: Variable Scope
What kinds of variables does Ruby support? Where are they accessible? When would you use them and what makes them different?

#### Option 3: Class Methods
Research class methods and desribe what they are, how to use them, and when you would use them.

#### Option 4: Blocs, Procs, and Lambdas
What are these? How do they work?

#### Option 5: Classes vs Modules
Describe and explain the purposes of classes and modules. How are they similar? How do they compare?

#### Option 6: Inheritance vs Composition
What is Ruby inheritance? What is composition? Which have you used this week? Create your own examples to explain how to use each.

<p>Object Oriented Programming is a programming methodology which allows to create transparent, reusable, easily maintainable and loosely coupled code. In an a large complex application, this makes the code flexible, easily modifiable and less prone to complex errors. That in turn, makes it less costly to operate on day to day basis and saves companies money over a long term.
</p><p>
The main difference between OOP and functional programming is the logical grouping of data and methods which are used to create, retrieve, update and delete data. In a well designed object oriented system, the logic is broken into objects which represent data (instance variables) and actions which can performed on those objects (methods). Object design should be very granular to contain as little logic as possible to make them clearly understood, thus easy to fix and reuse by other programmers. In contrast, functional programming does not allow to break the logic into small groups (objects) but rather allows to create a multitude of different functions that can interact with a large number of variables creating a very opaque and hard to understand systems which are prone to errors when code modification is required.</p>
<p>
As we discussed before, OOP design allows to group data into small, logical pieces of code called objects. Object variables represent meaningful data. There are different scopes of variables in Ruby, which means that those variables can be assigned the level of accessibility. There are 4 scopes of access: global, class, instance and local. If a variable is defined as global, it can be accessed (read and assigned a new value) by any object or method from anywhere in the application. Class scoped variables can be accessed by the class and all classes that are inherited from the class that defines the variable. Instance variables can only be accessed by the instances of a specified class and instances of inherited classes. Local variables are available only inside the methods or blocks where they were declared. Use of global variables is discouraged in OOP design, instead a singleton objects should be created in order to provide functionality across the application.
</p>
<p>Ruby classes also can contain methods which allow other objects to manipulate and access their data without exposing the inner workings of the class. This in fact allows to create code which is loosely coupled and easy to read as there are no long chains of function calls (also known as spaghetti code) which is typical of functional programming.
</p>
<p>Thus OOP programming has a number of advantages over functional programming in terms of code transparency, ease of modification and being less prone to error introduction over the application life cycle.
